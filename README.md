# Networks

## There are two code for generating...
<ul>
  <li> Random newtork </li>
  <li> Scale-free network </li>
</ul>

## What are they?  
>The radnom network model assumes that we add links between nodes *at random*.  
>Yet, most real networks new nodes prefer to link to the more connected nodes, a process called preferential attachment.
